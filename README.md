# Current Status

My aim is to turn this "Token Vendor" application into a DEFI protocol with some additional Functionality and features.
I'm updating this protocol every day but it'll take some time to get the fully working, tested and auditied final product in.
I'll soon update the documentation with the core functionality of this protocol.
